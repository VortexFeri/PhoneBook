# PhoneBook
A Phone Book program I made for an university assignment. It has the functionality to add, delete and edit contacts in a file named ```book.txt``` as well as print all the contacts in the console.

The program creates (if not already existent) a file called ```book.txt```, where it stores the contacts, each line corresponding to a contact and each element being separated by a ```~``` character.

When the user opens the program they are asked to type the password and if itâ€™s correct they are greeted by the main menu.

<B>NOTE!
When you open the app you will need to enter a password.
The password is ```password```.
